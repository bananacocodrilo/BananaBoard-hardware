# BananaBoard-hardware

This is still under development and subject to changes.

Split wireless keyboard based on the [mitosis](https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis-hardware) and the [chimera](https://github.com/GlenPickle/Chimera).

The goal is to make boards easy to solder and compatible with existing cases for popular keybards as "let's split" or "iris keyboard" and a miniboard for handwired builds.

I'll also publish a fork of their firmware as well since I need to use a matrix configuration instead of a "pin per switch", furthermore I'll add battery measure and underglow leds.
