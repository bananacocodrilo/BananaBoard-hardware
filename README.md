This is still under development and subject to changes.

Split wireless keyboard based on the [mitosis](https://github.com/reversebias/mitosis-hardware) and the [chimera](https://github.com/GlenPickle/Chimera).

The goal is to make boards easy to solder and compatible with existing cases for popular keybards as "let's split" or "iris keyboard" and a miniboard for handwired builds.

I'll also publish a fork of their firmware as well since I need to use a matrix configuration instead of a "pin per switch", furthermore I'll add battery measure and underglow leds.


I haven't make a PCB in a while and is my first time using kicad so I'm learning as a I go.

Current state:
-
 - "Finished" schematic: I like how it is right now and it probably will stay like this.
 - "Finished" a first version for handwired builds (it fits in 24mmx50mm so I added 2 per board).
 - First version of the PCB: It's probably not compatible with most of the "let's split" cases but I'll order a few to use them to develop the firmware.

Next steps: 
-
 - (Currently working) Measure the "let's split" pcb and modify the 40% ortho pcb to fit in the cases.
 - Investigate other lipo charger circuits. I've ordered a few cheap micro usb ones since I couldn't find reliable size info.
